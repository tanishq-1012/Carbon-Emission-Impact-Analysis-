# üåç Carbon-Emission-Impact-Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between global atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature anomalies over time. Using Python and publicly available datasets, it explores statistical patterns, trends, correlations, and seasonal variations to better understand the impact of carbon emissions on global warming.
Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of our time, with rising carbon emissions playing a pivotal role in driving global temperature anomalies. Analyzing the relationship between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature changes provides valuable insights into the underlying patterns and trends that shape our planet‚Äôs climate.

## üìä Project Objective

To analyze how rising CO‚ÇÇ levels correlate with global temperature anomalies and identify seasonal patterns that contribute to the broader climate change narrative.

## üìÅ Datasets Used

we aim to explore the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures. The focus will be on identifying historical trends, detecting anomalies, and simulating potential future scenarios to understand how changes in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations influence temperature anomalies.

For this, we will work with two primary datasets:

1. One containing annual temperature changes across multiple countries and decades,

2. Another featuring monthly CO‚ÇÇ concentrations measured globally.

By combining these datasets, we will investigate correlations, detect patterns over decades, and use predictive modelling to simulate ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios. This data-driven approach will provide actionable insights into the connection between carbon emissions and climate change, which can offer valuable context for sustainable policy-making.

Now let's get started with the task of Carbon Emissions impact Analysisby importig the necesssary Python libraries and the dataset 

<img width="724" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 43 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28149ca3-2a6d-4801-ac85-850d462b4ec8" />

We are using two datasets:

1. Temperature Data: Annual temperature anomalies measured in degrees Celsius across decades.
2. CO‚ÇÇ Data: Monthly global atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentrations in parts per million (ppm).

Now, let's calculate key statistics for tempreture changes and CO2 concentrations, such as mean, median, and varience:

<img width="470" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 43 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34b7a4ba-e2cb-405d-8aca-855b70fc7d61" />

The mean temperature change is approximately 0.54¬∞C, with a median of 0.47¬∞C and a variance of 0.43, indicating slight variability in temperature anomalies. For CO‚ÇÇ concentrations, the mean is 180.72 ppm, the median is significantly higher at 313.84 ppm, and the variance is 32,600, which reflects substantial variability in CO‚ÇÇ levels over the dataset‚Äôs timeframe. This highlights the stronger fluctuation in CO‚ÇÇ data compared to temperature changes.

## Time-Series Analysis

Next, we‚Äôll examine how temperature changes and CO‚ÇÇ concentrations have evolved overtime and the relationships between them:

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 44 25 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af90bdf0-61e5-442b-a473-114734570920" />

The time-series graph shows a consistent increase in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations (measured in ppm) over the years, which indicates the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Simultaneously, a slight upward trend in global temperature change suggests that rising CO‚ÇÇ levels are associated with global warming. The temporal alignment supports the hypothesis of CO‚ÇÇ‚Äôs significant contribution to temperature increase.

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 44 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9d00495-e6dd-4e19-b800-340362304da9" />

The heatmap reveals a strong positive correlation (0.96) between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature changes. This statistical relationship reinforces the observation that higher CO‚ÇÇ levels are closely linked with increasing global temperatures, which highlights the importance of addressing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change.

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 44 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93d47cca-4d89-4170-b96e-ff8b55339dbb" />

The scatter plot shows a clear linear trend, where higher CO‚ÇÇ concentrations correspond to greater temperature changes. This visual evidence underscores the direct relationship between CO‚ÇÇ emissions and global warming, which provides further support for policies targeting reductions in carbon emissions to combat climate impacts.

## Trends and Seasonal Variations Analysis

Now, let‚Äôs identify long-term trends and seasonal variations in the data using linear regression:

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 45 06 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cdf66b6-da41-4d73-8fe0-b92b94e9bd16" />

The graph shows the linear trends in both temperature change and CO‚ÇÇ concentrations over time, represented by their respective slopes. The CO‚ÇÇ trend has a much steeper slope (0.32) compared to temperature (0.03), which indicates a faster rate of increase in CO‚ÇÇ emissions relative to temperature change. This suggests that while CO‚ÇÇ levels are rising rapidly, the temperature impact, though slower, is accumulating steadily and may have long-term consequences.

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 45 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76c9db14-5a02-4496-b1bc-8275aca1bdd8" />

The above graph highlights the seasonal fluctuations in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations, which peak during late spring and early summer (around May) and reach the lowest levels in fall (around September). These variations are likely due to natural processes such as plant photosynthesis, which absorbs CO‚ÇÇ during the growing season, and respiration, which releases CO‚ÇÇ in the off-season. This seasonal cycle underscores the role of natural carbon sinks in moderating atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ levels.

## Correlation and Causality Analysis

To quantify the relationship between CO‚ÇÇ and temperature anomalies, we will now compute Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. And to investigate whether changes in CO‚ÇÇ cause temperature anomalies, we will perform Granger Causality tests:

<img width="446" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 45 46 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd431149-ff5a-4bba-8d27-170186b8d70f" />

Pearson Correlation (0.9554) indicates a very strong linear relationship between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature changes. Spearman Correlation (0.9379) indicates a very strong monotonic relationship between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature changes.

Granger Causality Test: The p-values for lags 1, 2, and 3 are as follows:

Lag 1: 0.0617 (slightly above the common significance threshold of 0.05, suggesting weak evidence for causality).

Lag 2: 0.6754 (not significant, no evidence of causality).

Lag 3: 0.2994 (not significant, no evidence of causality).
There is a very strong correlation between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature changes. 

However, Granger Causality tests do not provide strong evidence that changes in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations directly cause changes in temperature within the lags tested.

## Lagged Effects Analysis

Now, we will analyze whether CO‚ÇÇ concentrations from previous years (lagged values) influence current temperature anomalies. To do this, we will create lagged variables for CO‚ÇÇ concentrations, specifically shifting the data by 1, 2, and 3 years. These lagged values will allow us to test if historical CO‚ÇÇ levels have a delayed impact on temperature changes.

After creating these lagged variables, we will fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model. This model will use current and lagged CO‚ÇÇ levels as predictors to estimate their contribution to current temperature anomalies. By examining the regression results, we will determine:

1. How strongly current CO‚ÇÇ levels affect temperature changes.
2. Whether CO‚ÇÇ levels from previous years have a significant impact

<img width="575" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 46 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a6e5af7-dcf3-43c6-9623-017e1409a391" />

<img width="660" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 46 28 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c65236b-222d-47d7-8b67-7e5f8830b4e8" />

The OLS regression results indicate a strong relationship between CO‚ÇÇ concentration and temperature change, with an R-squared value of 0.949, meaning 94.9% of the variance in temperature change is explained by the model. The coefficient for CO‚ÇÇ concentration (0.3245) is statistically significant (p < 0.05), which suggests a positive association between CO‚ÇÇ levels and temperature change.

## Clustering Climate Patterns

Next, we group years based on similarities in temperature anomalies and CO‚ÇÇ concentrations using K-Means clustering:

<img width="1162" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 47 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b5e798-6775-4e1e-b028-7912656f7637" />

The clustering graph segments years into three distinct climate patterns based on CO‚ÇÇ concentration and temperature change: low CO‚ÇÇ and temperature (green), moderate CO‚ÇÇ and temperature (orange), and high CO‚ÇÇ and temperature (blue). The progression from green to orange and then to blue clusters reflects a clear trend of increasing temperature change corresponding to rising CO‚ÇÇ levels, effectively illustrating the correlation between greenhouse gas concentrations and global temperature variations.

This clustering emphasizes the cumulative and escalating impact of carbon emissions on global temperature patterns, which illustrates the need for targeted interventions to mitigate future increases.

## Predicting Temperature Changes Under What If Analysis

Now, we will use a simple linear regression model to simulate how changes in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations might influence global temperatures. By leveraging the historical relationship between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature anomalies, this model allows us to predict the potential impact of different emission scenarios.

First, we will train a linear regression model with CO‚ÇÇ concentrations as the input and temperature anomalies as the output. Once the model is trained, we can simulate hypothetical scenarios where CO‚ÇÇ concentrations increase or decrease by a specific percentage.

For each scenario, we will adjust the current average CO‚ÇÇ concentration by the specified percentage, feed it into the model, and predict the corresponding temperature anomaly. The scenarios we simulate include:

**Increase CO‚ÇÇ by 10%**: Predict the rise in temperature anomalies.
**Decrease CO‚ÇÇ by 10%**: Estimate the cooling effect.
**Increase CO‚ÇÇ by 20%**: Analyze the impact of more aggressive emissions growth.
**Decrease CO‚ÇÇ by 20%**: Evaluate the benefit of significant emission reductions.

<img width="549" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 47 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/330a731b-a819-43db-abc4-f252859a9083" />

A 10% increase in CO‚ÇÇ results in a notable rise in temperature anomalies, which demonstrates the sensitivity of global temperatures to CO‚ÇÇ levels. Conversely, a 10-20% reduction in CO‚ÇÇ could lead to significant cooling effects, which will potentially reverse some warming trends.
