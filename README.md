# üåç Carbon-Emission-Impact-Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between global atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature anomalies over time. Using Python and publicly available datasets, it explores statistical patterns, trends, correlations, and seasonal variations to better understand the impact of carbon emissions on global warming.
Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of our time, with rising carbon emissions playing a pivotal role in driving global temperature anomalies. Analyzing the relationship between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature changes provides valuable insights into the underlying patterns and trends that shape our planet‚Äôs climate.

## üìä Project Objective

To analyze how rising CO‚ÇÇ levels correlate with global temperature anomalies and identify seasonal patterns that contribute to the broader climate change narrative.

## üìÅ Datasets Used

we aim to explore the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures. The focus will be on identifying historical trends, detecting anomalies, and simulating potential future scenarios to understand how changes in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations influence temperature anomalies.

For this, we will work with two primary datasets:

1. One containing annual temperature changes across multiple countries and decades,

2. Another featuring monthly CO‚ÇÇ concentrations measured globally.

By combining these datasets, we will investigate correlations, detect patterns over decades, and use predictive modelling to simulate ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios. This data-driven approach will provide actionable insights into the connection between carbon emissions and climate change, which can offer valuable context for sustainable policy-making.

## Dataset

Now let's get started with the task of Carbon Emissions impact Analysisby importig the necesssary Python libraries and the dataset

We are using two datasets:

1. Temperature Data: Annual temperature anomalies measured in degrees Celsius across decades.
2. CO‚ÇÇ Data: Monthly global atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentrations in parts per million (ppm).

Now, let's calculate key statistics for tempreture changes and CO2 concentrations, such as mean, median, and varience:

<img width="470" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 43 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34b7a4ba-e2cb-405d-8aca-855b70fc7d61" />

The mean temperature change is approximately 0.54¬∞C, with a median of 0.47¬∞C and a variance of 0.43, indicating slight variability in temperature anomalies. For CO‚ÇÇ concentrations, the mean is 180.72 ppm, the median is significantly higher at 313.84 ppm, and the variance is 32,600, which reflects substantial variability in CO‚ÇÇ levels over the dataset‚Äôs timeframe. This highlights the stronger fluctuation in CO‚ÇÇ data compared to temperature changes.

## üìà Key Analyses

### 1. Statistical Summary

* Mean, median, standard deviation, variance, min, and max for both datasets.

* Insight: CO‚ÇÇ concentrations show a much higher range and variance than temperature anomalies.

### 2. Time-Series Visualization

* Line plots of CO‚ÇÇ levels and temperature anomalies from 1958 to 2023.

* Both variables show a clear increasing trend.

### 3. Correlation Analysis

* Pearson Correlation Coefficient: ~0.96

* A strong linear correlation exists between rising CO‚ÇÇ and global warming.

### 4. Linear Regression

* Linear trend lines applied to both datasets.

* Regression results show that both variables have statistically significant upward trends over time.

### 5. Seasonal Variation

Average CO‚ÇÇ concentration per calendar month across years.

Highest levels around April‚ÄìMay; lowest around September‚ÄìOctober, suggesting seasonal biosphere absorption.

## Time-Series Analysis

Next, we‚Äôll examine how temperature changes and CO‚ÇÇ concentrations have evolved overtime and the relationships between them:

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 44 25 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af90bdf0-61e5-442b-a473-114734570920" />

The time-series graph shows a consistent increase in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations (measured in ppm) over the years, which indicates the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Simultaneously, a slight upward trend in global temperature change suggests that rising CO‚ÇÇ levels are associated with global warming. The temporal alignment supports the hypothesis of CO‚ÇÇ‚Äôs significant contribution to temperature increase.

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 44 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9d00495-e6dd-4e19-b800-340362304da9" />

The heatmap reveals a strong positive correlation (0.96) between CO‚ÇÇ concentrations and temperature changes. This statistical relationship reinforces the observation that higher CO‚ÇÇ levels are closely linked with increasing global temperatures, which highlights the importance of addressing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change.

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 44 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93d47cca-4d89-4170-b96e-ff8b55339dbb" />

The scatter plot shows a clear linear trend, where higher CO‚ÇÇ concentrations correspond to greater temperature changes. This visual evidence underscores the direct relationship between CO‚ÇÇ emissions and global warming, which provides further support for policies targeting reductions in carbon emissions to combat climate impacts.

## Trends and Seasonal Variations Analysis

Now, let‚Äôs identify long-term trends and seasonal variations in the data using linear regression:

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 45 06 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cdf66b6-da41-4d73-8fe0-b92b94e9bd16" />

The graph shows the linear trends in both temperature change and CO‚ÇÇ concentrations over time, represented by their respective slopes. The CO‚ÇÇ trend has a much steeper slope (0.32) compared to temperature (0.03), which indicates a faster rate of increase in CO‚ÇÇ emissions relative to temperature change. This suggests that while CO‚ÇÇ levels are rising rapidly, the temperature impact, though slower, is accumulating steadily and may have long-term consequences.

<img width="1149" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 5 45 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76c9db14-5a02-4496-b1bc-8275aca1bdd8" />

The above graph highlights the seasonal fluctuations in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations, which peak during late spring and early summer (around May) and reach the lowest levels in fall (around September). These variations are likely due to natural processes such as plant photosynthesis, which absorbs CO‚ÇÇ during the growing season, and respiration, which releases CO‚ÇÇ in the off-season. This seasonal cycle underscores the role of natural carbon sinks in moderating atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ levels.
